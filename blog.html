                        <h5 style="text-align: center;"> 2023-01-22</h5>
                        <p class="blog-blog">
                            &emsp; &emsp;Since 2020 I have been running my own repair shop for smartphones and other mobile devices. During this time I’ve got many experiences, good ones but also bad ones. Many people think that running their own business has only benefits and they forget or don’t even think about the negatives.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;First,  I have to say I have never regretted that I went down this path in my life. I am the master of my time and every single decision I have in my hands. I consider that the biggest benefit. Nobody is standing above you all day and gives you hard times. You are the one who is in charge. If you are uncomfortable with something, you just don’t do it.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;As I said earlier, running my own business has many disadvantages as well. As an employee you are covered if you are sick for example, or currently you are struggling with getting enough customers. Your employer pays you your salary no matter what. If you are not working, you aren't making any money. It is simple. If you are lazy, or you aren’t innovative, your business will never grow and get bigger. In my case, I am dealing directly with the customers and that is very difficult. Sometimes, I order spare parts for a customer and then he doesn't show up. That means spare parts are never used and I lose money. Just to give a fresh example from last week, parcel service damaged my package. This is also an unpleasant event because my customer is waiting for my service and the problem happened on my site and I was incapable of resolving this situation.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;To summarise, running a business is not for everyone. It depends on your mindset, you also need a little bit of courage and you must be able to solve problems at runtime. If you have a good idea, then my advice is to go for it. If everything goes well, then great, otherwise you will only be smarter for the future.

                        <h5 style="text-align: center;"> 2023-01-29</h5>
                        <p class="blog-blog">
                            &emsp; &emsp;There are many people in the world who work as programmers. But not everyone went to college and studied programming. Some of them are learning programming on their own. Is it possible to study on your own and be on the same level of knowledge as a college student? No, haha.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Personally, I am also learning programming on my own. We are living in the times when we have many many options in how to learn something and we are surrounded with information. I consider it   a hurdle in my journey. Sometimes you just don’t know how to start and where to start. What is important and let’s say what is less important to know at that moment. Yes, there are many courses out there but you as an amateur have no idea if it's the right way. This applies to all the articles, online forums and every other place where you can learn. On the contrary to college  where your study is provided by experienced professors. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;I am not sure what I should say about the pleasures of self-learning. In your life you may have many reasons why you can’t go to college. Yes, as an autodidact  I can confirm this. It’s not easy. In many cases you will be in this alone, but don’t worry, you just have to try and not give up. And this is the biggest pleasure. Results. May you struggle, may you not be able to find the right way, but if you don’t give up, I am sure eventually you will be successful and that feeling is what you are looking for. You can? find a solution on your own. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;In the end my advice is: practice is the way. Of course, theory is a very important part of the journey, but practice makes you better in a tangible way. You will understand many things only once you try them in practice despite that you may have read them hundreds of times. Nobody was borned with knowledge already in their head so don’t be sad or disappointed if something does not work the first time you try it. Just give it another shot.

                        <h5 style="text-align: center;"> 2023-02-05</h5>
                        <p class="blog-blog">
                            &emsp; &emsp;At the beginning of the article we meet Emily Zurek Small. She is a former college student and she is a nice example of the idea of the article. 
	                        <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;The main idea of the article is what is a common mistake of many students around the globe. The main difference between Ms. Emily and many other students is a willingness to learn. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;In our times students often don’t understand the power of knowing. In college or at any school that they are studying they are focusing only on particular knowledge, because they believe that this is the only thing that they could use in their future lives, precisely in their future careers. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Careerism is assumed to be one of the biggest obstacles on the path to willingness to learn. Many students consider college only as a job training. They refuse to learn other things, which they probably won't use in their future careers.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Another big obstacle is assuming that people are always already informed. The philosopher, sir Jonathan Lear named this attitude as knowingness. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;As the article says, you are a worker only for part of your life, but a human being with a powerful brain for your whole life.    
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;All people should be gaining as much knowledge as possible. General knowledge could put you on a higher level of interest, moreover, you will be able to make interesting conversations with other people.

                        <h5 style="text-align: center;"> 2023-02-12</h5>
                        <p class="blog-blog">
                            &emsp; &emsp;The main point of this chapter is to introduce to you how even tiny changes may change your life. In this chapter we have nice examples from real life.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;The British Cycling Organization was struggling for many years for poor results. In 2003 they recast the performance director and he came with that philosophy. He had made small but many changes in every possible place. The reaction to those changes was a significant improvement for professional riders. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Improvement in our lives should be on a daily basis. We are expecting magnification improvement by making big changes but this is a wrong mind set. Nothing happens overnight. Think about yourself, where you could be, if you made only 1% improvement per day since last year. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;All big things come from small things. Every single habit comes from a tiny single decision. The important part of this is that the habit must be repeated. After that the habit will grow and become stronger. 
                             Plateau of Latent Potential- as the author describes, the results may not be seen immediately, you have to give it time.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Be aware, the way, which one you use, is more important than the goal itself. May it happen, that after reaching the goal, we are satisfied with the result and our motivation goes to zero. This is the opposite of habits, and what we are trying to do.

                            &emsp; &emsp;The second chapter is trying to explain why it is easier to repeat bad habits, and why it is much harder to create new ones. The author describes that there are two reasons why it is challenging to change our habits. We are trying to change the wrong things and we are changing it in the wrong way. In this chapter we are going to look at the first one.       
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Three layers of behaviour change are outcomes, processes and identity. First one, change outcomes, describe mostly our goals. What we want to achieve. The second layer - processes, under this layer belongs the ways that can get us to achieve our goals. The deepest layer is the identity layer. This layer refers to changes such as your mindset or worldview. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Many people are focused on their goals and how to get them. But the important part is also the identity layer change. The change must come also from the inside, from the mind. 	It is hard to change something without changing yourself. Setting goals and setting the way to accomplish those goals is not enough. Important part is also to change your nature and your mindset. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;It could be said that your habits define your identity. The way to change who you are is to change what you do.

                            &emsp; &emsp;Psychologist Edward Thorndike was doing an experiment with cats. He discovered that repeating one action that gives us pleasure and reward is better to build a habit than an action which doesn't have a good and positive effect on us. This is the key to successfully creating a habit.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Habits are behaviours and actions that we repeat many times, and our mind does it automatically. Habits are shortcuts that make our lives easier.  
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;We can describe the creation of a habit in four steps. A cue, a craving, a response and a reward.  
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;Cues are predicting a reward. They are an impulse. Cravings bring us motivation for what we want to achieve. The response represents the habit itself. The reward is the main goal of habit. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;It is important to regularly repeat those four steps to create new habits. The author is calling those steps The Four Laws of Behavior Change.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;We can divide those laws into two phases. Problem phase that contains Cue and Craving steps and Solution phase - Response and Reward steps.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;The author defined a set of rules for creating a new good habit, but also for removing a bad one. For example, for creating a new habit: Cue - Make it obvious, Craving - Make it attractive, Response - Make it easy, Reward - Make it satisfying. For breaking some bad habits we can invert those rules.

                            &emsp; &emsp;Chapter 4 starts with a story about a paramedic woman who saves the life of her father-in-law and about military analysts and their work with radar systems. Those stories have one thing in common and that is - if you are doing something repeatedly, your brain starts noticing important things, learning patterns and storing them for future use.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;If you get enough experience with some specific thing, your brain is able to detect and deal with it without thinking about it - automatically. Those experiences may print directly into your unconscious mind. This can have a positive influence for good habits but also it could be dangerous for the bad ones.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;If we want to build a new habit, it is important to take control over existing ones. It could be hard because they are mostly subconscious and you are doing it automatically.
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;There is a process named Pointing-and-Calling. The main idea is that while you are doing something, you point at things and name them out loud. With this approach your consciousness takes control over this action. 
                            <br><br> &emsp; &emsp;It is wrong to call habits with names such as good or bad. It always depends on your goal. If you want to lose weight, maybe it is good for you to eat less, but for other people who want to gain some muscle, eating is important and prosperous. It is a good approach to scoring your habits and giving them value.
